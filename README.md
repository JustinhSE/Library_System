# üìöLibrary_System

This project is a command-line interface (CLI) program for managing a library's system. The program is written in Java and provides the following menu options:

- **B** - Manage Book Repository: Allows the user to add, remove, print, and sort books in the library's repository based on specific criteria, such as ISBN number, book name, author name, genre, year, and condition.
- **C** - Checkout Book: Allows the user to checkout a book from the library by entering the book's ISBN number.
- **N** - Add New Book: Allows the user to add a new book to the library's repository by entering the book's details, such as ISBN number, book name, author name, genre, year, and condition.
- **R** - Remove Book: Allows the user to remove a book from the library's repository by entering the book's ISBN number.
- **P** - Print Repository: Allows the user to print the entire book repository or a subset of it based on specific criteria, such as ISBN number, book name, author name, genre, year, and condition.
- **S** - Sort Shelf: Allows the user to sort the books in the library's repository based on specific criteria, such as ISBN number, book name, author name, genre, year, and condition.
- **R** - Manage Return Stack: Allows the user to manage the return stack, which stores the books that are returned to the library.
- **R** - Return Book: Allows the user to return a book to the library by entering the book's ISBN number.
- **L** - See Last Return: Allows the user to see the last book that was returned to the library.
- **C** - Check In Last Return: Allows the user to check in the last book that was returned to the library.
- **P** - Print Return Stack: Allows the user to print the entire return stack or a subset of it based on specific criteria, such as ISBN number, book name, author name, genre, year, and condition.
- **Q** - Quit: Allows the user to quit the program.
